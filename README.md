Barnaby Dibben - Comp 3016 for the University of plymouth

This project is aimed to be a space ship fly around simulator with Asteroids in proximity.

To add to the space feel:
 - Left mouse button activates a laser sound effect
 - Right button plays some fun space-themed music

To give the impression of a spaceship flying around:
- W Propells you forward
- A Moves you left
- D moves you right
- S moves you backwards
- Space will move you up
- Left shift will move you down

  (Theres an easter egg in the console if you press 'm')
